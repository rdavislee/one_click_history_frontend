# User Journey: Discovering Boston

Alex is visiting Boston for the first time and wants to learn about the city's history. After logging in to One Click History, they see the home screen with a sidebar labeled "Previous Chats" on the left (empty for now) and a coordinate selection area in the center. Standing in Boston Common, Alex clicks the **"Use My Location"** button, which prompts the browser to request location permission. After allowing access, the latitude and longitude fields automatically fill in with their current coordinates.

Next, Alex adjusts the **radius slider** to select how wide an area to explore—they choose **1 km**, sliding between options ranging from 100 meters to 1000 kilometers. The label updates to show "Search Radius: 1km" as they move the slider. Satisfied with the settings, they click the **"Start Chat"** button.

The chat screen appears with a beautiful gradient header showing "Boston Common" at the top. Within moments, a comprehensive historical context appears—from Boston's founding as a colonial hub to its pivotal role in the American Revolution, explaining how the city shaped American independence and became a center of education and innovation. The narrative is beautifully formatted with **bold text** for emphasis and proper markdown styling.

Scrolling through the narrative, Alex notices mentions of universities and types a question in the input box at the bottom: "What role did MIT play in Boston's history?" They click **"Ask"** and a response appears explaining MIT's founding in 1861 and how it transformed the city into a technology and research powerhouse. Still curious, Alex asks another question: "What's the history of the ocean and harbor here?" The answer describes Boston Harbor's crucial role in colonial trade, the Tea Party, and its evolution into a modern port.

After exploring, Alex clicks the **"← Back to Home"** button to return to the main screen. The next day, exploring a different neighborhood, Alex opens the app and sees their previous chat "Boston Common" listed in the sidebar with yesterday's date. One click brings back the full conversation—the initial context and all their questions and answers—exactly as they explored it before, ready to share with friends or dive deeper. What started as a simple question about a new city has become an ongoing exploration, with each discovery just one click away.

# User Journey: Discovering Boston

Alex is visiting Boston for the first time and wants to learn about the city's history. Standing in the Common, they open One Click History and tap the prominent "EXPLORE" button on the home screen. The app uses their current location and generates a historical overview of Boston—from its founding as a colonial hub to its pivotal role in the American Revolution, explaining how the city shaped American independence and became a center of education and innovation.

Scrolling through the narrative, Alex notices mentions of universities and types a question: "What role did MIT play in Boston's history?" A response appears explaining MIT's founding in 1861 and how it transformed the city into a technology and research powerhouse. Still curious, Alex asks another question: "What's the history of the ocean and harbor here?" The answer describes Boston Harbor's crucial role in colonial trade, the Tea Party, and its evolution into a modern port.

The next day, exploring a different neighborhood, Alex opens the app's history sidebar and sees "Boston - Revolutionary Hub" saved from yesterday. One click brings back everything they learned, ready to share with friends or dive deeper. What started as a simple question about a new city has become an ongoing exploration, with each discovery just one click away.
